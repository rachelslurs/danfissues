#Fisch has issues with things. Let's learn more about these Fissues.

### Participate
- Submit a Fissue
- Assign Dan to the Fissue
- Dan/Rachel will Label it (smells, moist, tender)

### Closing Fissues
- Closed issues are for things Dan actually likes.
- Once Dan says he doesn't like something, we use the label "wontfix"
